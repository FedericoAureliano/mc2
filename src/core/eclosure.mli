(** Equality closure using an union-find structure.
    This module implements a equality closure algorithm using an union-find structure.
    It supports adding of equality as well as inequalities, and raises exceptions
    when trying to build an incoherent closure.
    Please note that this does not implement congruence closure, as we do not
    look inside the terms we are given. *)

module type Key = sig
  (** The type of keys used by the equality closure algorithm *)

  type t
  val hash : t -> int
  val equal : t -> t -> bool
  val compare : t -> t -> int
  val print : Format.formatter -> t -> unit
end

module type S = sig
  (** Type signature for the equality closure algorithm *)

  type t
  (** Mutable state of the equality closure algorithm. *)

  type var
  (** The type of expressions on which equality closure is built *)

  exception Unsat of var * var * var list
  (** Raise when trying to build an incoherent equality closure, with an explanation
      of the incoherence.
      [Unsat (a, b, l)] is such that:
      - [a <> b] has been previously added to the closure.
      - [l] start with [a] and ends with [b]
      - for each consecutive terms [p] and [q] in [l],
        an equality [p = q] has been added to the closure.
  *)

  val create : Backtrack.Stack.t -> t
  (** Creates an empty state which uses the given backtrack stack *)

  val find : t -> var -> var
  (** Returns the representative of the given expression in the current closure state *)

  val add_eq : t -> var -> var -> unit
  val add_neq : t -> var -> var -> unit
  (** Add an equality of inequality to the closure. *)

  val add_tag : t -> var -> var -> unit
  (** Add a tag to an expression. The algorithm ensures that each equality class
      only has one tag. If incoherent tags are added, an exception is raised. *)

  val find_tag : t -> var -> var * (var * var) option
  (** Returns the tag associated with the equality class of the given term, if any.
      More specifically, [find_tag e] returns a pair [(repr, o)] where [repr] is the representant of the equality
      class of [e]. If the class has a tag, then [o = Some (e', t)] such that [e'] has been tagged with [t] previously. *)
